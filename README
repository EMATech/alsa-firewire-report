Enhancement of ALSA firewire stack

Description
========
June 2014, ALSA, Linux sound subsystem, merged an enhancement of support for Firewire sound devices, and it was pulled to Linux 3.16. This is a report about my work for the enhancement, including my memo.


Status

Under reviewing the whole section.

I have a little experiences for technical writing and English writing. This report may include mistakes in grammar. I'm happy if you inform such mistakes to me.

How to read
========
Please refer to firewire.pdf. I'll keep it as the latest version of my report.

How to build
========
Need some softwares to process text and images:
 - GNU Make
 - LaTeX
 - Inkscape, to generate from svg
 - Graphviz, to generate from dot

Then execute make.
