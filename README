I have a little experiences for technical writing and English writing. This report may include mistakes in grammar. I'm happy if you inform such mistakes to me.

How to read

Please refer to firewire.pdf. I'll keep it as the latest version of my report.

How to build
========
Need some softwares to process text and images:
 - GNU Make

Then execute make.
